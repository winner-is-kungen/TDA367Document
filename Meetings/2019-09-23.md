* The folowing requirements have been decided:
  * The ability to drag n drop new components onto a blueprint
  * To be able to connect components in the view and model
  * To be able to run a logic simulator on the components
 
* To be able to reach these requirements we have constructed the folowing tasks:
   * Create a factory for diffrent components
   * A function to give the view a list of all available components
   * A class for visual representation of the model
   * A factory for said class
   * Connect said factory to the view
   * Fix infinity loop problem of self-inputing components
   * Create a Blueprint class to contain and manage components
   * Make sanity checks on new connection in blueprint
   * Create Workspace class to contain and manage blueprints ( It should be able to list and return specific blueprints)
